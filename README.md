# JamLib: A Game Jam Library

This is a very basic multipurpose library to use on top of p5.js. It is designed to help out with the GMTK Game Jam that is due to happen for 2023.

Check the example folder for a very simple p5js scene which makes use of some of the JamLib classes. It can also be used as a bootstrap for a new p5js project.
